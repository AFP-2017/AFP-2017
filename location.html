<h2>Location</h2></br>

The summer school will be held in the <em>Buys Ballot Gebouw</em>
(Buys Ballot Building) on the Utrecht Science Park, <em>De
Uithof</em>. The lectures will be in room 205; the lab sessions will
be in rooms 106 and 109.

<h3>Getting here</h3>

When traveling by public transportation from Utrecht Central Station
to the Uithof, you can take either bus 12 to bus stop Padualaan or bus
28/128 to bus stop Botanische Tuinen. At both stops, you should be
able to see the following buildings just beyond the bus stop.

The low red building, the <em>Minnaertgebouw</em> is currently being
renovated. The Buys Ballot Gebouw is just behind the Minnaertgebouw,
with the large
<em>Universiteit Utrecht</em> logo on the roof.

Upon entering the building, take the elevator to the 5th floor. The
coffee room where you can register is immediately adjacent to the
elevators.

<h3>Public transport</h3>

Although you can pay for your bus tickets on the bus, it might be a
good idea to purchase an <em>OV chipkaart</em> which lets you pay by
swiping your card. Fares are typically a bit cheaper when paid with
a <em>chipkaart</em> as opposed to cash on the bus. You can find more
